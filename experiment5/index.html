				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is my 3D Graphic experiment. Press Mouse1 to destroy the generated 4 towers. The height of all the towers should be randomly generated.

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It uses Canon.js to have physics for the boxes. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In this project, I wanted to simulate and earthquake using physics. But that ended up changing when I thought it would be way cooler to have the towers just break when the mouse button is clicked. 
					I had no clue how to implement canon.js so I'm very glad ChatGPT was able to help me acheieve what I wanted.
