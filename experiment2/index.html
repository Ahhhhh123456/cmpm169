				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I chose the constraint of Cycles in Nature in lunar phases. I didn't want to do all of them so I decided to only choose 4 of them.
					I have waning gibbous (Top Left), Third Quarter (Bottom Left), First Quarter (Top Right), and a Full Moon (Bottom Right).
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It uses the generative method noise to create a bunch of lines that end up making the shape similar to a moon if you let it run for long enough </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In this project, I worked on a majority of all the changes (and with the help fo chatgpt). Of course the original code wasn’t mine but it helped as a great starting point. 
					A low point I had in this was trying to figure out how to make 4 “moon”s being made at the same time. This took me I would say roughly 1 ½ days to figure it out.
					 Everything past the low point I had was a high point in my opinion as my progress through this Experiment went way faster.</p>
